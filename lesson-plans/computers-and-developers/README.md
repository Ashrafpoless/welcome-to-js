# Computers & Developers

Explore how Computers and Developers read the same code in different ways.

## Prep Work

- Look through [Suggested Study](../../suggested-study.md?render)
  - _What is Programming?_
  - _What is JavaScript?_
- Play [compute-it](http://compute-it.toxicode.fr/) through level 15
- Install (and/or update)
  [Study Lenses](https://github.com/hackyourfuturebelgium/welcome-to-js#setting-up) -
  see the Setting Up section
- Go through the [../../0-study-lenses](../../0-study-lenses/README.md?slides)
  guide so you're ready for class
- Learn a little about variables:
  - (study your favorites of all these)
  - [They're like boxes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvrszgiexg0)
  - [JS Fundamentals - Variables](https://javascript.info/variables)
  - [JS Variables](https://education.launchcode.org/intro-to-professional-web-dev/chapters/data-and-variables/variables.html)
  - [JavaScript Variables and Constants](https://www.programiz.com/javascript/variables-constants)
- from `javascript.info`: [DevTools](https://javascript.info/devtools),
  [Debugging Chrome](https://javascript.info/debugging-chrome)
- Study
  [/3-understanding-programs/1-predicting-execution](../../3-understanding-programs/1-predicting-execution/?--defaults)
  - `devtool-setup.mp4`
  - `guide.mp4`
  - the JS files

## Learning Objectives

- ü•ö **Code Audiences**: You can explain how a single file of code is understood
  by:
  - **Computers**: A computer follows the code's instructions one step at a
    time.
  - **Developers**: A developer reads the code, comments and variable names to
    understand what the code is _intended_ to do.
- üê£ **Tracing Variables**: You can follow a program's instructions like the
  computer does, filling out a _trace table_ and checking your work with the
  [trace] button.

## During Class

The most important objective for today is that you learn how to trace variables
the way a computer interprets them. If you don't understand this the rest of JS
will be a mystery!

### Before Break

- **All Together**:
  - Discuss the diagram with _source code_, _developers_ and _computer_
  - Discuss where you can write & run JavaScript
  - Study the `tracing-variables` examples all together on a coach's screen
    - Demonstrate different study techniques and lenses
- **In Small Groups**:
  - Study examples 4 & 5 again with your classmates
  - Begin `tracing-variables/exercises`
